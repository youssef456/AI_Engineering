# 🚀 AI Engineering Projects

Welcome to **AI_Engineering**, a collection of hands-on AI projects I built while completing the **AI Engineer Bootcamp 2025** on Udemy.  
This repository demonstrates practical applications of AI, NLP, Large Language Models, LangChain, vector databases, and more.

## 📚 About This Repository

AI Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that combines:

- Python programming for AI
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformers
- LangChain and AI agents
- Vector databases (Pinecone)
- Speech recognition and Streamlit applications

This repository consolidates projects that cover the full AI engineering workflow — from building models to deploying AI-driven applications. Each project builds upon the previous, providing a structured path to mastering AI engineering skills.
